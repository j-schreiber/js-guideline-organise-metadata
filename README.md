# About

This repository provides a guideline for Salesforce architects how to organise Salesforce metadata. Some components work very well with unlocked packages, others don't.
Here, I gather insights about how these components behave in reality, beyond the limited information from the [Metadata Coverage Report](https://mdcoverage.secure.force.com/docs/metadata-coverage).

This repository is constantly updated, as the Metadata API and SFDX evolve. However, most recommendations are based on non-technical constraints and are not very likely to change anytime soon.

# How To Use

You can find all recommendations in the [metadata-types](metadata-types) folder. Each type has a brief readme with more details.
