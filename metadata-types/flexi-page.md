# Organisation

Mostly **UNPACKAGED**.

# Considerations

- Flexi Pages are similar to Layouts. They are constantly updated and usually have to reference fields or LWC/Aura components from multiple packages.
- Salesforce constantly adds new features to flexi pages. Dynamic Forms and Dynamic Actions, they have replaced layouts by now.
- Lightning Email Templates are also deployed as flexi pages. Maintaining those from source is much harder than classic templates, and not recommended.
