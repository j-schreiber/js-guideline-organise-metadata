# Organisation

**2GP** only.

# Considerations

- You shouldn't use aura any more. Move to [LWC](lightning-component-bundle.md) instead for better developer experience and testability.
- Aura components are usually not stand-alone. They are regularly added to flexi pages, quick actions and flows.
- It makes sense to develop and deploy your components in a second-generation package (either as a library package or functional package) and _use_ the components from unpackaged source.
