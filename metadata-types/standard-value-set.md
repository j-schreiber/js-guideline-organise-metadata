# Organisation

Almost always **happy-soup** for the definition.

Use **2GP** only for value sets that rarely change.

# Considerations

- See [Record Type](record-type.md) for considerations how to filter picklist value entries for standard fields.
- Usage of standard picklists is very hard to contain in a single package. Adding one to a package usually comes with major downsides.
- If one package added a standard value set, no other package can own it (and be installed in the same org).
