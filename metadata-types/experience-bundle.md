# Recommendation

Only **unpackaged**.

# Considerations

- The supported metadata format is completely unusable. Experience can only be modified from the drag-and-drop experience builder. There is no benefit in maintaining experiences from source.
- Experience builder and navigation menus throw a lot of unexpected exceptions, when trying to push source on Scratch orgs.
- Communities cannot be deployed like regular source. You need to publish them additionally.
- Scratch orgs with the communities feature enabled generate several boiler plate apex classes, that hinder the development process.
- Experience bundle source from a specific API version is usually incompatible with other API versions.

# Subtypes

The recommendations include custom sites, networks and navigation menues.
