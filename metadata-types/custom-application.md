# Organisation

Primarily **UNPACKAGED** for complex and general purpose applications that integrate many custom objects

**2GP** for specialized applications from a particular package.

# Considerations

- Record type / profile specific overrides for flexipages are stored in custom application source (`profileActionOverride`).
- Profiles are rarely part of packages, therefore most packaged custom applications that require specific flexi pages have to be overwritten in unpackaged.
