# Organisation

**UNPACKAGED**.

# Considerations

- Groups are mostly used to organise users for user-based sharing (reports, records, email templates, etc).
- Group members (especially the users) are specific to an org and do not need to be maintained in source.
- Additionally groups are used for admin-based sharing (sharing rules) and should be deployed together with sharing rules that reference them.
