# Recommendation

Only **unpackaged**.

# Considerations

- Translations of path assistants are not yet supported by Metadata API.
- Path assistants are regularly updated, because process instructions may change often.
- If the assistant references a standard value set (e.g. `CaseStatus`, `LeadStatus`), deployment is buggy. In many cases, the assistant cannot be deployed because of internal errors.
