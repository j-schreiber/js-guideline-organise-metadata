# Organisation

**2GP** only.

# Considerations

- In a healthy team and an org that is actively developed, apex classes get renamed, deleted and created a lot.
- They are one of the few metadata components, that cannot be modified on production via UI and must be changed using an API deployment.
- The automatic deletion of removed apex classes during package upgrades is an absolute game changer.
